I'm also an senoir making thsi my last year in IACS. I'm an determine and hardworking in my classes,but outside of school i'm actaully an nice and outgoing person once you get to know me. My hobbies I like to do is walking,playing basketball,and driving.</p> <h3>Goals</h3> <ul> <p> My goals that I have for this class is to learn new things before I leave school, and get improving more in coding throughout the semsters. The reason why I chose these two goals because learning an new skill such coding or programing could be useful for an activiy or side plan. I found this goal very good for me so it can challenges me in my learning and overcome that challenge by doing better than before and learning my mistakes.

We land the idea of making an game based on cholcate bar which was so easy to do, We then use many different kinds of cholcate bar such as snickers,hersely,twix,crunch,etc. 
After that we then set up random questions and whatever you chose for your answer in each question the end will choose what is your favorite cholcate bar.</p> </ul> </h3><h3>HTML</h3><h3> <ul> <img src="HTMLPhoto" alot="HTMLPhoto.png" width="124" height="123"> <p></p> </ul> </h3><h3>Style</h3><h3> <ul> <p></p></ul> </h3><h3>Main.js</h3><h3> <ul> <p></p></ul></h3> </body></html>
