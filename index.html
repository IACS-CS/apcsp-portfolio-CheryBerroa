I'm a student at Innovation Academy Charter School. I'm also a senior, making this my last year at IACS. I'm determined and hardworking in my classes, but outside of school, I'm actually a nice and outgoing person once you get to know me. My hobbies include walking, playing basketball, and driving.</p> <h3 data-aos="fade-right">Goals</h3> <p data-aos="fade-right">My goals for this class are to learn new things before I leave school and to improve more in coding throughout the semesters. I chose these two goals because learning a new skill such as coding or programming could be useful for an activity or side project. I find this goal beneficial as it challenges me in my learning, helping me overcome challenges by performing better than before and learning from my mistakes.</p> <h3 data-aos="fade-right">Interests</h3> <ul> <li data-aos="fade-left">In my free time, I love to explore new things and learn a lot from them. I actively try to push myself to overcome difficult challenges, such as computer science.</li> </ul> <h3>Projects</h3> <ul> <li>Binary Search</li> </ul>  </body></html> <!-- HTML Code goes here w/ "Astro" templating in curly brackets --><html lang="en"> <head><meta charset="UTF-8"><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initialScale=1.0"><title>
