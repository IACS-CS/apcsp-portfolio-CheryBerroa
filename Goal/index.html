I chose these goals because learning to code can help me with side projects and future jobs. It challenges me to think more, solve problems, and learn from my mistakes, all while building my confidence for future opportunities.</p> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>Some of my challenges in this class are staying focused when coding gets tough and understanding new ideas quickly. I also find it hard to fix mistakes in my code sometimes, especially when I can't figure out what's wrong. Balancing this class with my other work is another challenge, and itâ€™s hard to find enough time to practice coding. Plus, applying new things I learn to real projects can be tricky.</p>  </body></html>
