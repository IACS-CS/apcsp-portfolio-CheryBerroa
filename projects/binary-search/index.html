Project: Cholocate bar game </h1> <nav> <a href="../../">Back to Portfolio</a> </nav> </header> <article>  <main> <h2>Overview</h2> <p>
In this project, my group and I created a game from scratch based on chocolate bars. The game determines which chocolate bar you are most like based on your answers to a series of questions.
</p> <h2>How It Works</h2> <p>
The game begins by asking the user for their name. Then, it presents a series of questions related to personal preferences, such as favorite colors, seasons, and activities. Each question has multiple-choice answers that guide the user toward discovering their ideal chocolate bar.
</p> <h2>Visuals</h2> <p>
Here's a screenshot of the project interface, giving a glimpse of how users interact with the game.
</p> </main>  <iframe src="https://iacs-cs.github.io/binary-search-game-tikka-masala/" title="Personality Quiz" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe> <main> <h3>HTML</h3> <p>
The HTML for our chocolate bar quiz game, "Vite App," sets up the overall structure. It features a main content area called "app," where players will see the quiz questions and results. This document also connects to main.js, the file that brings the game to life with interactivity.
</p> <h3>Style</h3> <p>
Our CSS styles the game to create an inviting experience. By removing margins and padding, we achieve a clean layout. The dark gray background makes the text pop, while a grid layout centers everything nicely on the page. This way, players can focus on enjoying the quiz without distractions.
</p> <h3>Main.js</h3> <p>
The main.js file is where the magic happens. It starts by asking the player for their name, then guides them through a series of fun questions about their preferences. Based on their answers, the game reveals which chocolate bar theyâ€™re most like, complete with a friendly message. At the end, players can choose to try the quiz again or exit, always receiving a thank you for playing.
