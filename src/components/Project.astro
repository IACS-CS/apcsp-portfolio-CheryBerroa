      <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, my group and I created a game from scratch based on chocolate bars. The game determines which chocolate bar you are most like based on your answers to a series of questions.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The game begins by asking the user for their name. Then, it presents a series of questions related to personal preferences, such as favorite colors, seasons, and activities. Each question has multiple-choice answers that guide the user toward discovering their ideal chocolate bar.
