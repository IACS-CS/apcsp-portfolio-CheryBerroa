  <h3>HTML</h3>

  The HTML for our chocolate bar quiz game, "Vite App," sets up the overall structure. It features a main content area called "app," where players will see the quiz questions and results. This document also connects to main.js, the file that brings the game to life with interactivity.
</p>

<h3>Style</h3> 

<p>
  Our CSS styles the game to create an inviting experience. By removing margins and padding, we achieve a clean layout. The dark gray background makes the text pop, while a grid layout centers everything nicely on the page. This way, players can focus on enjoying the quiz without distractions.
</p>

<h3>Main.js</h3>
<p>
  The main.js file is where the magic happens. It starts by asking the player for their name, then guides them through a series of fun questions about their preferences. Based on their answers, the game reveals which chocolate bar theyâ€™re most like, complete with a friendly message. At the end, players can choose to try the quiz again or exit, always receiving a thank you for playing.
