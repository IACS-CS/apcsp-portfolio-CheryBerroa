  assignment="Create a simulation to model the spread of a disease within a population"
>
<main>
  <h3>Describe what you did for your two simulations</h3>
  <p>
In the first simulation, we created a model to show how a disease spreads through a population, tracking how healthy individuals get infected and potentially die based on infection and death rates. Then, as for the second situation, we added a vaccination option in this model to see how vaccinating individuals can reduce the spread of the disease and lower the number of deaths.
  </p>

  <h3>What elements of the real world did you attempt to capture in your model?</h3>
  <p>
COVID-19 spreads from infected to healthy people; some may die, while others recover. In the second model, vaccination helps reduce the spread and deaths, with emojis representing different age groups to show how the disease affects each group.
  </p>

  <h3>What insights into the behavior of diseases can you make based on the output of your model? Include at least one screenshot showing an interesting output.
</h3>
  <p>
The model shows that higher infection rates lead to more infections. Vaccination reduces infections and deaths. Emojis represent age groups ðŸ§“ for elderly, ðŸ‘¶ for kids, showing different impacts. Some recover, others die, revealing long-term population effects.  </p>

<h3> What important elements of the real world are left out of your model?
 </h3> 
<p> The model doesn't show people avoiding crowds, how diseases change, or how movement affects spread. It also misses medical treatments and quarantine measures.

  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>
    The HTML for our disease simulation sets up the structure of the interface. It contains elements for displaying the population status, infection statistics, and buttons for starting the simulation or resetting it. The HTML organizes the layout to clearly show relevant information to the user.
  </p>

  <h3>Style</h3> 
  <p>
    Our CSS styles the simulation to ensure that itâ€™s easy to follow and visually engaging. We used a clean layout to display important data like infection rates and recovery statistics. The design aims to keep the user focused on the simulation's progress and results.
  </p>

  <h3>Main.js</h3>
  <p>
    The main.js file controls the logic of the disease simulation. It handles the population creation, disease spread mechanics, and updates the statuses of individuals based on the parameters set (such as infection chances, recovery rates, etc.). This is where all the calculations happen that determine how the disease spreads, how many people get infected, recover, or die, and how the simulation progresses over time.
