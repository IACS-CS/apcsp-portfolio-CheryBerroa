<Project
  title="Turtle Mini Drawing"
  assignment="Choosing a drawing of any kind and letting the program draw it out"
>

   <p>
     In this project, we were tasked with creating a drawing that can be customized by the user through commands. The goal was to break down the drawing into smaller parts, each represented by a separate function. These functions should take parameters, allowing for customization of each part. For example, if drawing a house, there could be functions like <code>drawRoof</code>, <code>drawWindow</code>, or <code>drawDoor</code>, each with specific parameters such as size or shape.
   </p>
   <p>
     We used HTML to structure the page and create a canvas for drawing. CSS was used to style the layout, such as ensuring the drawing space was clear and user-friendly. JavaScript was the core of this project, where we wrote the functions to draw various shapes and parts. By using commands entered by the user, JavaScript allowed us to dynamically update the drawing, offering an interactive experience.

     Through this project, we learned how to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively. HTML provided the skeleton for the webpage, CSS made it visually appealing, and JavaScript brought the drawing to life with interactive functions. The project also taught us the importance of collaboration, as each group member was responsible for writing one or more functions, each contributing to the overall drawing.
