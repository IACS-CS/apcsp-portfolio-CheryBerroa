<Project
  title="Image Filter"
  assignment="Create a program to apply a filter to an image"
>
<main>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we created a program that allows you to choose from a list of filters and apply your selected filter to an image. The filter modifies the image's pixels, altering things like color, brightness, contrast, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    First, you choose which filter you want to apply from the list of available filters. Then, you upload an image of your choice, and once the image is loaded, the filter is applied automatically. The program modifies the image and displays the result with the new filter applied, showing the changes in real-time.
  </p>

  <h2>Visuals</h2>
  <p>
    Below, you can see the project in action. The page features a menu bar with a list of filters, and a section where you can upload and preview images. The filtered image will be displayed after you apply your chosen filter.

  <h3>HTML Structure</h3>
  <p>
    The HTML provides the structure for the page, organizing the filter menu and the area where the image will be displayed. It connects to the <code>main.js</code> file, which handles the filter logic and image manipulation.
  </p>

  <h3>CSS Style</h3>
  <p>
    The CSS styles the page, creating a clean and simple layout. It ensures that the interface is easy to navigate, with a dark background and a focused layout, allowing users to interact with the filters and image easily. The design is responsive, so it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
  </p>

  <h3>main.js: JavaScript Logic</h3>
  <p>
    The main.js file contains the logic that makes the filters work. It handles the loading of images, applying the selected filter to the image, and then displaying the modified image. The JavaScript uses algorithms to modify the image's pixels, adjusting properties like contrast, saturation, and brightness based on the selected filter.
