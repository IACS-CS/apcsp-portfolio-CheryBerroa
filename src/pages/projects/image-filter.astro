 <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    In this project, We have to choose one of the filter from the list and apply that same filter that we chose to one of the images.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
    First you have to apply which challenge you want to do it can any of your choice then choose an image of your liking and once you do you then apply the filter onto the image an it will show.

  <h3>HTML Structure</h3>
  
    The HTML is what builds the structure of the game. It sets up the main part of the page where players will see the quiz questions and results. The HTML connects to the <code>main.js</code> file, which makes the game interactive.
  </p>

  <h3>CSS Style</h3>
  <p>
    The CSS is what makes the game look nice. It gives the page a dark background and a clean layout, so players can easily focus on answering the questions. The page is also designed to look good on any screen size, whether on a phone or computer.
  </p>

  <h3>main.js: JavaScript Logic</h3>
  <p>
    The main.js file is the brain of the game. It starts by asking for your name and then takes you through a series of fun questions. Based on your answers, it uses binary search to figure out which chocolate bar you match with. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the quiz is done, you get a fun result showing which chocolate bar matches your personality. You can choose to play again or leave, with a thank-you message at the end.
