<p> My goals that I have for this class is to learn new things before I leave school, and get improving more in coding throughout the semsters. The reason why I chose these two goals because learning an new skill such coding or programing could be useful for an activiy or side plan. I found this goal very good for me so it can challenges me in my learning and overcome that challenge by doing better than before and learning my mistakes.

<h3>Overview<h3>
<ul>
<p>In this project, me and my group had to create a game from scratch. 
We land the idea of making an game based on cholcate bar which was so easy to do, We then use many different kinds of cholcate bar such as snickers,hersely,twix,crunch,etc. 
After that we then set up random questions and whatever you chose for your answer in each question the end will choose what is your favorite cholcate bar.</p>
</ul>

<h3>HTML<h3>
<ul>
<img src="HTMLPhoto" alot="HTMLPhoto.png" width="124" height="123">
<p>This HTML document is a basic setup for a web page. It indicates that the page is in English and uses a standard character set. The title shown in the browser tab is "Vite App." In the body, there’s a div labeled app, which will be where the main content appears. Lastly, it includes a JavaScript file called main.js that will run the app’s code.
</p>
</ul>

<h3>Style<h3>
<ul>
<p>This CSS code styles the body of a web page by removing margins and padding for a clean look. It sets a dark gray background and uses a grid layout to center the content both vertically and horizontally. The body also takes up the full width of the page and has a minimum height that matches the visible area of the browser, creating a modern and user-friendly design.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Main.js<h3>
<ul>
<p>This JavaScript code sets up a fun quiz where users can find out which chocolate bar they are most like. It imports a CSS file for styling and a "Text Interface" module for user interactions. The game starts by asking for the player’s name and then presents a series of choices about their favorite subjects, seasons, countries, and colors. Based on these answers, it reveals a chocolate bar that matches their personality, complete with a message and an image. At the end, users can choose to play again, and if they decide not to, the game thanks them for participating.</p>
</ul>
