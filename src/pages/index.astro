  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Chery Berroa. I'm a student at Innovation Academy Charter School. I'm also a senior, making this my last year at IACS. I'm determined and hardworking in my classes, but outside of school, I'm actually a nice and outgoing person once you get to know me. My hobbies include walking, playing basketball, and driving.</p>
  
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>My goals for this class are to learn new things before I leave school and to improve more in coding throughout the semesters. I chose these two goals because learning a new skill such as coding or programming could be useful for an activity or side project. I find this goal beneficial as it challenges me in my learning, helping me overcome challenges by performing better than before and learning from my mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, my group and I created a game from scratch based on chocolate bars. The game determines which chocolate bar you are most like based on your answers to a series of questions.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The game begins by asking the user for their name. Then, it presents a series of questions related to personal preferences, such as favorite colors, seasons, and activities. Each question has multiple-choice answers that guide the user toward discovering their ideal chocolate bar.

<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>
  The HTML for our chocolate bar quiz game, "Vite App," sets up the overall structure. It features a main content area called "app," where players will see the quiz questions and results. This document also connects to main.js, the file that brings the game to life with interactivity.
</p>

<h3>Style</h3>
<p>
  Our CSS styles the game to create an inviting experience. By removing margins and padding, we achieve a clean layout. The dark gray background makes the text pop, while a grid layout centers everything nicely on the page. This way, players can focus on enjoying the quiz without distractions.
</p>

<h3>Main.js</h3>
<p>
  The main.js file is where the magic happens. It starts by asking the player for their name, then guides them through a series of fun questions about their preferences. Based on their answers, the game reveals which chocolate bar they’re most like, complete with a friendly message. At the end, players can choose to try the quiz again or exit, always receiving a thank you for playing.
