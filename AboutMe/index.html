I'm a student at Innovation Academy Charter School. I'm also a senior, making this my last year at IACS. I'm determined and hardworking in my classes, but outside of school, I'm actually a nice and outgoing person once you get to know me.</p> <h3 data-aos="fade-right">Hobbies</h3> <p data-aos="fade-left"> In my own free time, I like to play basketball, walk to different places, and hang out with my friends. I also enjoy watching movies, trying new foods, and spending time outdoors, whether it's going to places that I never been to or just relaxing at the park.</p> <h3 data-aos="fade-right">Interests</h3> <ul> <p data-aos="fade-left">In my free time, I love to explore new things and learn a lot from them. I actively try to push myself to overcome difficult challenges, such as computer science, by tackling complex problems and constantly improving my skills. I also enjoy experimenting with new hobbies, whether it's coding a new project, learning a musical instrument, or diving into books that broaden my perspective. This curiosity and drive to grow help me stay motivated and open to new opportunities.</p> </ul>  </body></html> <!-- HTML Code goes here w/ "Astro" templating in curly brackets --><html lang="en"> <head><meta charset="UTF-8"><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initialScale=1.0"><title>
